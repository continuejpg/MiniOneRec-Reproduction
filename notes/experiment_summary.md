# MiniOneRec — Authoritative Experiment Record

**Status.** This file is the single authoritative record of the experiments run in this
repository. Every headline number below is traceable to a prediction artifact in
`runs/` and was re-derived by machine from that artifact, not copied from an earlier
document. Where a number could not be traced, it is marked as such rather than filled in.

**Verification command.** `python analysis/audit_predictions.py` re-scores every
prediction artifact against its own split; `python analysis/verify_summary_claims.py`
machine-checks the headline metrics and the intervention-coverage claim in §10.

## 1. Experiment scope

Reproduction of the MiniOneRec pipeline (Semantic ID → SFT → GRPO → constrained beam-search
generative recommendation) on **Amazon Industrial_and_Scientific**, plus a controlled
intervention on the Semantic-ID assignment and a compact sequential baseline.

| Line of work | What it answers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Clean SFT baseline | How strong is constrained SID generation after one SFT pass? | complete |
| GRPO benchmark | Does ranking-GRPO on top of SFT improve broad Top-K quality? | complete |
| GRPO efficiency | Can the GRPO training pipeline be made much cheaper at equal quality? | complete |
| Compact SASRec baseline | How does a non-generative sequential model compare? | complete |
| SID observational analysis | How does quality vary with popularity and with target–history SID prefix affinity? | complete |
| Shuffled-SID controlled intervention | Does the item↔SID assignment itself carry the signal? | complete |

**Out of scope / not attempted:** multi-seed repeats, SOTA chasing, heavy SASRec tuning,
Steam or Office_Products migration, new reward functions, new RL algorithms.

## 3. Correctness fixes

Changes made to the upstream code before the recorded runs. All are in the repository
history; none alter the evaluation protocol.

### 3.1 Training reproducibility / correctness

- **Zero-advantage logging** added to the GRPO trainer so the group-relative-advantage
  degeneracy can be measured instead of guessed.
- **Namespaced `sample_id`** and `task_type` so that sample identity survives DataFrame
  sampling (the upstream `seq:{local_idx}` form silently renumbered rows).
- **Train/valid split identity** folded into the sequential sample IDs; train/eval
  sample-ID collisions removed.
- **Reward binding by `sample_id`**, fail-loud, replacing prompt-text matching.
- **Shared `build_recommendation_prompt()`** so the SFT and evaluation prompt text cannot
  drift apart.

### 3.2 Evaluation-protocol fix

The **formal** evaluation prompt differs from an earlier, pre-unification evaluation
(see §13). The pre-unification artifacts are retained only as legacy/debug evidence and
are excluded from every table in this document.

### 3.3 Documented non-findings

- The custom cosine scheduler defined in `sft.py` is **dead code**: the `optimizers=`
  argument that would install it is commented out, so SFT trains with the
  `TrainingArguments` default **linear** schedule. Confirmed by the logged LR
  trajectory, which decays smoothly and linearly to 0.
- Rescaling probabilities over legal SID tokens did **not** remove the KL outliers (§12).

## 5. Clean SFT baseline

**Artifact:** `runs/eval_clean_sft/test_beam20.json` (4 533 samples × 20 candidates)

| K | HR | NDCG |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.06926980 | 0.06926980 |
| 3 | 0.10103684 | 0.08789727 |
| 5 | 0.12111185 | 0.09613706 |
| 10 | 0.15376131 | 0.10663781 |
| **20** | **0.19832341** | **0.11786798** |

- Training: 2 496 steps, final `train_loss` 0.7712 (mean over all logged steps).
- Decoding audit: **100.0000 %** of the 90 660 emitted candidates are legal catalogue
  SIDs, **0** duplicate candidates, every candidate is exactly one 3-token SID.

> **Do not confuse these with the legacy numbers.** An earlier evaluation of the same
> checkpoint under a pre-unification prompt reported HR@20 = 0.15376131 and
> NDCG@20 = 0.08471693 (`runs/eval_industrial/`). That is the *legacy* protocol and is
> retained only as debug evidence (§13). In particular, **0.15376131 is the legacy HR@20,
> not the unified HR@10** — an earlier version of this file mixed the two.

---

## 6. GRPO benchmark

All GRPO arms start from the clean SFT checkpoint. Every row below was re-scored from its
own prediction artifact with `calc.py`.

| Arm | Checkpoint | HR@1 | HR@3 | HR@5 | HR@10 | **HR@20** | **NDCG@20** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clean SFT | `industrial_sft/final_checkpoint` | 0.06926980 | 0.10103684 | 0.12111185 | 0.15376131 | **0.19832341** | **0.11786798** |
| GRPO 0.25 ep (original) | `grpo_short025/checkpoint-4379` | 0.06794617 | 0.09463931 | 0.11361129 | 0.14251048 | **0.17626296** | **0.10885475** |
| GRPO 0.25 ep (optimized) | `grpo_fast025/checkpoint-4379` | 0.06750496 | 0.09596294 | 0.11030223 | 0.14096625 | **0.17538054** | **0.10824989** |
| GRPO 1.5 ep | `grpo_baseline/checkpoint-26274` | 0.07059343 | 0.09309508 | 0.10566953 | 0.13214207 | **0.16170307** | **0.10470676** |
| GRPO 2.0 ep | `grpo_baseline/final_checkpoint` | 0.07037282 | 0.09309508 | 0.10434591 | 0.12971542 | **0.16236488** | **0.10447064** |

### 6.1 Checkpoint ↔ epoch labels (corrected)

| Checkpoint | Trained fraction | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `checkpoint-4379` (`grpo_short025`, `grpo_fast025`) | **0.25 epoch** | `train.log` max `epoch` = 0.25 over 4 379 steps |
| `checkpoint-26274` (`grpo_baseline`) | **1.5 epoch** | intermediate checkpoint of the 2-epoch run |
| `grpo_baseline/final_checkpoint` | **2.0 epoch** | `train.log` max `epoch` = 2.0 over 35 032 steps |

An earlier version of this file labelled `checkpoint-4379` as 1.5 epoch and pointed the
1.5-epoch row at the wrong artifact. **`checkpoint-4379` is 0.25 epoch.**

### 6.2 Conclusion

> **Under the fixed 17.5k GRPO subset, the ranking reward and the current training
> configuration, GRPO did not improve broad Top-K quality over SFT.** Every GRPO arm
> scores below the SFT baseline on HR@20 and NDCG@20.

This is **not** a statement that GRPO is ineffective for recommendation in general. No
claim is made about other subsets, rewards, reward weights, algorithms, or datasets —
none of those were varied.

## 7. GRPO efficiency optimization

Source of the gain:

1. remove repeated full-validation evaluation during training
2. remove redundant intermediate checkpoint saves
3. final offline evaluation protocol left **unchanged**

| Metric | Original 0.25 ep | Optimized 0.25 ep | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| wall-clock | 6 111.5734 s (101.9 min) | 1 598.1889 s (26.6 min) | **−73.8 %** |
| throughput | 0.717 step/s | 2.74 step/s | **3.82×** |
| peak VRAM | 7.628 GB | 7.628 GB | unchanged |
| HR@20 | 0.17626296 | 0.17538054 | −0.088 pp |
| NDCG@20 | 0.10885475 | 0.10824989 | −0.060 pp |

All six numbers are read from `grpo_short025/train.log`, `grpo_fast025/train.log`, the two
prediction artifacts, and the per-step `peak_vram_gb` series in
`runs/_EXTRACTED_metrics/*.txt` (max = 7.627975 GB for both arms).

**Wording.** The quality change is **approximately preserved**, not lossless: HR@20 moves
by −0.088 pp and NDCG@20 by −0.060 pp. This is a **single-seed** engineering comparison;
disabling stochastic during-training evaluation can change RNG consumption, so identical
optimization trajectories are **not** assumed.

---

## 8. Compact SASRec baseline

**Artifacts:** `runs/sasrec_baseline/d_h64_neg100_metrics.json` (stored grid) and an
independent per-sample reconstruction from `d_h64_neg100.pt`, which reproduces the stored
numbers to floating-point precision.

Configuration: hidden 64, 1 head, sequence length 10, dropout 0.3, 200 epochs,
negative-sampling objective with 100 negatives, seed 42 — the best of a 4-config sweep.

**Formal Protocol-B (SID-level Top-20) test results:**

| K | HR | NDCG |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.04213545 | 0.04213545 |
| 3 | 0.04588573 | 0.04435719 |
| 5 | 0.04742996 | 0.04499325 |
| 10 | 0.05537172 | 0.04756201 |
| **20** | **0.07147584** | **0.05156672** |

**Clean SFT HR@20 ÷ compact SASRec HR@20 = 0.19832341 / 0.07147584 ≈ 2.77×.**

### 8.1 Required caveats (these bound the claim)

1. **Compact baseline.** This is a small single-block SASRec, not a heavily tuned one;
   it does not represent the achievable ceiling of the SASRec family.
2. **Shared metric, different mechanisms.** Both are scored with the same SID-level Top-K
   metric, but their candidate generation and scoring differ fundamentally: MiniOneRec
   emits a constrained 3-token SID sequence with beam search; SASRec scores the full
   catalogue with a dot product and then maps items to SIDs.
3. **Uncontrolled variable.** The SFT arm is trained with SID↔title / SID↔description
   alignment auxiliary tasks; SASRec has no such objective. This is **not** controlled for.

> Therefore the correct statement is that clean SFT attains roughly 2.77× the HR@20 of this
> compact SASRec under a shared SID-level metric. **It is not a claim of a fully
> controlled, like-for-like defeat of SASRec.**

---

## 9. SID observational analysis

All results in this section are **observational**. No causal claim is made. Sources:
`analysis/results/sid_value_analysis.json`, `sid_prefix_control.json`,
`sid_prefix_matched_control.json`.

### 9.1 Popularity stratification

Strata are defined by how often the target item appears as a next-item label in **train**.
The `f = 0` stratum is called **interaction-unseen** — *not* cold-start, which would imply
a different (content-based) notion.

HR@20 by stratum (test n = 4 533):

| Stratum | n | SASRec | Clean SFT | GRPO 0.25 orig | GRPO 1.5 ep | GRPO 2.0 ep |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| interaction-unseen (f=0) | 156 | 0.00000 | 0.00000 | 0.01923 | 0.05769 | 0.05769 |
| f=1 | 211 | 0.00000 | 0.01896 | 0.03791 | 0.07109 | 0.06635 |
| f=2 | 312 | 0.00320 | 0.02244 | 0.04167 | 0.05449 | 0.05449 |
| f=3-5 | 940 | 0.00213 | 0.03298 | 0.03830 | 0.05000 | 0.04681 |
| f=6-20 | 1 630 | 0.00491 | 0.15890 | 0.16626 | 0.13436 | 0.14172 |
| f>20 | 1 284 | 0.24377 | 0.46573 | 0.36449 | 0.33178 | 0.32788 |

**Correct summary.** The bulk of SFT's *absolute* gain over compact SASRec sits in the
**medium and head** strata (f=6-20: +15.4 pp; f>20: +22.2 pp), while SASRec is essentially
inoperative in the sparse strata. GRPO's changes are a **popularity-dependent
redistribution**: the longer GRPO runs improve the interaction-sparse strata relative to
SFT (f=0: 0.00000 → 0.05769; f=1: 0.01896 → 0.07109) but lose substantially in the
medium/head (f>20: 0.46573 → 0.32788), which nets out to a lower overall Top-K.

**Not supported:** "SFT's advantage is concentrated in the tail." The tail is where SFT is
close to *zero* in absolute terms; the absolute gain is in the medium/head.

### 9.2 Target–history SID prefix affinity

Affinity is measured as the **token-level longest common prefix (LCP)** between the target
SID and any history SID. *(An earlier revision compared SID **characters** instead of
tokens, which made `<a_2>` look like a prefix of `<a_223>`; that bug produced empty
depth-0/1/2 strata and has been fixed.)*

HR@20 by LCP depth:

| Depth | n | freq median | SASRec | Clean SFT | GRPO 0.25 orig | GRPO 1.5 ep | GRPO 2.0 ep |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (no shared prefix) | 2 711 | 8 | 0.03762 | 0.04832 | 0.03098 | 0.01512 | 0.01291 |
| 1 (`<a_x>`) | 1 041 | 7 | 0.03074 | 0.15370 | 0.11527 | 0.08453 | 0.08742 |
| 2 (`<a_x><b_y>`) | 566 | 10 | 0.07951 | 0.70141 | 0.67491 | 0.69435 | 0.70495 |
| 3 (target in history) | 215 | 491 | 0.67442 | 0.98140 | 0.99070 | 0.98140 | 0.98140 |

**Finding.** Deeper target–history SID prefix affinity is **strongly associated** with
higher HR@20. Because the `f=0` stratum is a 491-median-frequency repeat-consumption case,
depth 2 → 3 is a qualitatively different regime and is listed separately rather than read
as a trend.

### 9.3 Matched branch-size control

To test whether §9.2 is merely an artefact of "a small catalogue branch is easy to hit",
every sample is given **one common control variable**:

> `target_prefix2_support` = number of unique catalogue SIDs sharing the target SID's
> first two tokens — used for **every** depth level.

HR@20 inside the same support bucket:

| `target_prefix2_support` | Depth | n | freq median | Clean SFT | GRPO 0.25 orig | GRPO 1.5 ep | GRPO 2.0 ep |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 1 312 | 8.0 | 0.06021 | 0.04878 | 0.01982 | 0.01829 |
| 1 | 1 | 309 | 8.0 | 0.11327 | 0.09385 | 0.05502 | 0.06149 |
| 1 | 2 | **0** | — | — | — | — | — |
| 2-5 | 0 | 1 111 | 8.0 | 0.03870 | 0.01440 | 0.00810 | 0.00720 |
| 2-5 | 1 | 498 | 7.0 | 0.21084 | 0.15663 | 0.10442 | 0.10442 |
| 2-5 | 2 | 110 | 7.5 | 0.61818 | 0.60909 | 0.59091 | 0.60000 |
| 6-20 | 0 | 227 | 10.0 | 0.02643 | 0.00441 | 0.00441 | 0.00441 |
| 6-20 | 1 | 147 | 6.0 | 0.09524 | 0.06122 | 0.06803 | 0.07483 |
| 6-20 | 2 | 184 | 9.0 | 0.65217 | 0.58696 | 0.57065 | 0.60326 |
| 21-100 | 0 | 61 | 23.0 | 0.04918 | 0.04918 | 0.08197 | 0.03279 |
| 21-100 | 1 | 87 | 10.0 | 0.06897 | 0.04598 | 0.10345 | 0.10345 |
| 21-100 | 2 | 272 | 17.5 | 0.76838 | 0.76103 | 0.81985 | 0.81618 |
| >100 | any | **0** | — | — | — | — | — |

**Finding.** After matching on the common control variable, depth 2 still far exceeds
depths 0 and 1 in every bucket where it exists (e.g. support 2-5: 0.61818 vs 0.21084 for
SFT). A frequency-band × support × depth triple split (cells with n ≥ 30) shows the same
ordering throughout. So **"small trie branch alone" does not fully explain the effect.**

**Two structural facts, not defects.** (a) `depth = 2` cannot occur in the
`support = 1` bucket — a branch containing only the target cannot share two tokens with
any history item. (b) No test sample has `support > 100`. Both cells are reported as empty
rather than filled.

**Caveat.** This remains **observational evidence, not causal proof.** Depth correlates
with item and user-history properties that are not controlled here.

---

## 10. Shuffled-SID controlled intervention

### 10.1 Design

The intervention destroys the **item↔SID assignment** while holding the **SID codebook**
fixed. Built by `analysis/build_shuffled_sid_strict.py`, seed 42, deterministic.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| catalogue items | 3 686 |
| unique SIDs | 3 670 |
| SID tokens | 560 |
| collision-involved items | **31 intentionally frozen** at their original SIDs (not shuffled) |
| singleton items permuted | **3 655** |
| permutation unit | whole 3-token SID codes, within train-frequency strata |
| bucketing | 0 / 1 / 2 / 3-5 / 6-20 / >20 by train next-item frequency |

**Intervention strength**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| singleton exact-SID retention | **0.0000 %** |
| all-item exact-SID retention | **0.8410 %** (= the 31 intentionally frozen items) |
| prefix-1 self retention (singleton) | 2.4077 % |
| prefix-2 self retention (singleton) | 0.0547 % |
| **pair-identity retention, depth 1 (all)** | **2.8155 %** (Jaccard 1.4279 %) |
| **pair-identity retention, depth 2 (all)** | **0.6885 %** (Jaccard 0.3454 %) |
| pair-identity retention, depth 2 (singleton) | **0.0494 %** (Jaccard 0.0247 %) |

Pair-identity retention is `|BEFORE_pairs ∩ AFTER_pairs| / |BEFORE_pairs|`, where a pair is
an unordered item pair whose SIDs share a prefix. *(An earlier revision reported
`|AFTER_pairs| / |BEFORE_pairs|` over prefix-group counts, which is identically 100 %
because a within-bucket permutation preserves every group's SID set. That definition
measured group-size preservation, not pair identity, and has been replaced.)*

**Held invariant** (verified, 18/18 checks pass in
`analysis/results/shuffled_sid_preflight.json`): exact SID set, exact SID multiset, SID
token vocabulary, trie prefix sets at depth 1/2/3, collision group membership, popularity
strata, user and item identity, titles and descriptions, sequence lengths, and the SFT
recipe.

> **The 31 frozen items are retained, not removed.** They appear in the shuffled train,
> valid and test files exactly as in the clean ones, with their original SIDs; they are
> trained on and evaluated like any other item. "Frozen" means only that their
> item↔SID assignment was deliberately left unshuffled, which is what keeps the collision
> structure and the exact SID multiset intact. They are therefore part of the evaluation,
> not excluded from it — but they carry no treatment, so a null result cannot be
> attributed to them and a positive result cannot be explained by them.

### 10.2 Intervention coverage

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| test examples | 4 533 |
| **prompts changed** | **98.81 %** (54 rows unchanged) |
| **targets changed** | **93.01 %** (317 rows unchanged) |

**Machine-verified:** the 317 rows whose target SID is unchanged are **exactly** the rows
whose target item is one of the 31 intentionally frozen collision-involved items
(`unchanged_output_rows == frozen_rows`, with `|set difference| = 0` in both directions).
So the unchanged targets correspond to intentionally frozen collision-affected examples.
The 54 unchanged **prompts** are *not* the same set (only 23 overlap) and this document
makes no claim about them.

### 10.3 Result

**Headline**

| Metric | Clean SFT | Shuffled-SID | Absolute Δ | Relative Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **HR@20** | 0.19832341 | 0.10765497 | **−0.09066844** | **≈ −45.72 %** |

**Decoding health** (`analysis/results/shuffled_eval_provenance.json`, 18/18 checks pass):
LegalRate@20 = **100 %**, DuplicateRate@20 = **0 %**, unique predictions per sample = **20**
for all 4 533 rows.

**Interpretation.** Under a controlled intervention that holds the SID codebook, token
vocabulary, trie topology, popularity strata and SFT recipe essentially fixed while
altering the item↔SID assignment, Top-K recommendation quality drops sharply. This
**provides strong controlled-intervention evidence that semantic SID assignment
contributes substantially to MiniOneRec SFT performance.**

**It does not prove Semantic ID is the sole cause.** The intervention is a single
manipulation at one scale, on one category, with a single seed; the 31 collision-involved
items were intentionally frozen rather than shuffled, so for those items the item↔SID
assignment carries no treatment; and the training run carries the resume caveat in §13.

## 11. Final comparison table

Formal test split, K = [1, 3, 5, 10, 20]. **Two different decoding/scoring regimes are
shown, and the shared quantity is only the SID-level Top-K metric:**

**Generative runs** (rows 2-7 — clean SFT, all GRPO arms, shuffled-SID SFT)

- `beam = 20`
- `length_penalty = 0`
- constrained SID decoding (the trie restricts every step to legal SID tokens)
- `num_return_sequences = 20`; 4 533 test samples

**Compact SASRec, Protocol B** (row 1)

- item-level Top-20 scoring (full-catalogue dot product over 3 686 items)
- the 20 scored items are then mapped to SID
- therefore it shares the **same SID-level Top-K hit rule and NDCG cutoff** as the
  generative runs, which is what makes the comparison meaningful
- but its **candidate generation and scoring mechanism differs fundamentally**: no beam
  search, no length penalty, no constrained SID decoding, and no SID-sequence generation

| # | System | Regime | Split | HR@1 | HR@5 | HR@10 | **HR@20** | **NDCG@20** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Compact SASRec (Protocol B) | item-level Top-20 → SID | clean | 0.04213545 | 0.04742996 | 0.05537172 | **0.07147584** | **0.05156672** |
| 2 | **Clean SFT** | beam 20, constrained SID | clean | 0.06926980 | 0.12111185 | 0.15376131 | **0.19832341** | **0.11786798** |
| 3 | GRPO 0.25 ep original | beam 20, constrained SID | clean | 0.06794617 | 0.11361129 | 0.14251048 | **0.17626296** | **0.10885475** |
| 4 | GRPO 0.25 ep optimized | beam 20, constrained SID | clean | 0.06750496 | 0.11030223 | 0.14096625 | **0.17538054** | **0.10824989** |
| 5 | GRPO 1.5 ep | beam 20, constrained SID | clean | 0.07059343 | 0.10566953 | 0.13214207 | **0.16170307** | **0.10470676** |
| 6 | GRPO 2.0 ep | beam 20, constrained SID | clean | 0.07037282 | 0.10434591 | 0.12971542 | **0.16236488** | **0.10447064** |
| 7 | **Shuffled-SID SFT** | beam 20, constrained SID | shuffled | 0.06132804 | 0.08824178 | 0.09816898 | **0.10765497** | **0.08157358** |

Rows 1-6 are scored on the clean test split; row 7 uses the shuffled test split because its
target SIDs are the shuffled ones.

**Provenance differs by regime, and was verified separately:**

- **Rows 2-7 (generative):** re-scored from their own `test_beam20.json` /
  `eval_beam20.json` artifacts with the unmodified `calc.py`; every headline value matched
  its recorded metric to `|diff| = 0.000e+00`. See
  `analysis/results/shuffled_eval_provenance.json` and `analysis/audit_predictions.py`.
- **Row 1 (compact SASRec):** `calc.py` does not apply to it. Its numbers come from
  `runs/sasrec_baseline/d_h64_neg100_metrics.json` (`results.test.protocol_B_top20_sid_level`)
  and were independently cross-checked by re-running the trained
  `d_h64_neg100.pt` checkpoint to reconstruct the 4 533 × 20 candidates and recomputing the
  grid, which reproduced the stored values to floating-point precision (see §8).

**Ordering.** Clean SFT > every GRPO arm > shuffled-SID SFT > compact SASRec on both
HR@20 and NDCG@20. Because row 1 comes from a different regime, the ordering statement is
about the shared SID-level Top-K metric, not about a like-for-like decoder comparison
(the caveats in §8.1 apply).

## 12. Failure diagnostics: zero-advantage groups and KL

Diagnostics extracted from the per-step records in `runs/_EXTRACTED_metrics/*.txt`.
These are **observations**, not fixes, and they are not used to explain recommendation
quality.

| Run | steps logged | zero-advantage group ratio | KL median | KL p95 | KL p99 | KL max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRPO 0.25 ep original | 4 379 | **69.856 %** | 0.0413 | 1.132 | 36.800 | 1.047e8 |
| GRPO 0.25 ep optimized | 4 379 | **70.153 %** | 0.0417 | 0.9997 | 28.914 | 1.047e8 |
| GRPO 2.0 ep | 35 032 | **69.277 %** | 0.0411 | 2.117 | 173.083 | 1.761e11 |
| GRPO smoke (debug) | 34 300 | 77.187 % | 0.0398 | 2.444 | 172.797 | 7.678e10 |

**Observed**

- A high zero-advantage ratio (≈70 %) is present from early training: for roughly seven of
  every ten groups the reward is constant, so the group-relative advantage is zero and the
  step contributes no learning signal.
- The KL distribution is strongly heavy-tailed, with maxima spanning 8-11 orders of
  magnitude above the median.
- Extreme KL was **not** primarily caused by singleton / forced trie branches.
- Re-normalising probabilities over legal SID tokens did **not** remove the KL outliers.

Consistent with §6, these observations describe the reward configuration as run; they do
not support any general claim about GRPO.

## 13. Provenance and caveats

### 13.1 Prediction sources

| Label | Artifact | Split |
|---|---|---|
| Clean SFT | `runs/eval_clean_sft/test_beam20.json` | clean |
| GRPO 0.25 ep original | `runs/grpo_short025/eval_beam20.json` | clean |
| GRPO 0.25 ep optimized | `runs/grpo_fast025/eval_beam20.json` | clean |
| GRPO 1.5 ep | `runs/eval_grpo_step26274/test_beam20.json` | clean |
| GRPO 2.0 ep | `runs/eval_grpo_baseline/test_beam20.json` | clean |
| Shuffled-SID SFT | `runs/eval_shuffled_sid/test_beam20.json` | shuffled |
| Compact SASRec | `runs/sasrec_baseline/d_h64_neg100_metrics.json` | clean |

### 13.2 Legacy / debug artifacts — excluded from every table above

| Artifact | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| `runs/eval_industrial/final_result_Industrial_and_Scientific.json` | evaluated **before** prompt unification; HR@20 = 0.15376131, NDCG@20 = 0.08471693. Legacy protocol, not comparable. |
| `runs/_EXTRACTED_metrics/grpo_smoke_metrics.txt` | debug smoke run; diagnostics only (§12). |

### 13.3 Shuffled-SFT training resume caveat

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| completed steps | 2 496 |
| interrupted after | ≈ step 2 180 |
| `resume_from_checkpoint` | `checkpoint-2125` |
| retrained steps | **2 125 – 2 180** |

Consequences, stated plainly:

- clean vs shuffled are **not** a bitwise-identical optimization trajectory. Final LR
  reconverged to the identical value 1.21163166e-07 and the loss trajectory is continuous
  across the resume, but a material-divergence-free comparison is not assumed.
- The resume summary reports `train_loss = 0.060042…`. **This is a resumed-segment
  statistic and must not be used as the full training loss.** The reconstructed
  all-step means are **shuffled ≈ 0.802715** and **clean ≈ 0.771231**.
- Training loss is recorded here for provenance only. It is **not** used to explain
  recommendation quality.

### 13.4 `--info_file` correction (superseded conclusion)

An earlier revision of the evaluation audit asserted that the shuffled evaluation **must**
replace `--info_file`, "otherwise constrained decoding would restore the original
item↔SID mapping and undo the intervention." **That claim was wrong and is withdrawn.**

`evaluate.py` uses `--info_file` for exactly one purpose: reading field 0 (the SID string)
and building the constrained-decoding trie. The item_id field is never read, and the title
field is tokenised into a dictionary that is built and never consumed. The trie is a
function of the **SID codebook alone**, and the strict shuffle preserves that codebook
exactly. Measured for the two info files (`analysis/verify_info_equivalence_final.py`):

| Quantity | Result |
|---|---|
| legal SID sequence set | identical |
| trie prefix keys | 9 684 both, key sets identical |
| allowed-token **sets** per prefix | 0 differences |
| EOS termination nodes | 3 670 both, identical |
| decoding masks | **byte-identical** (same MD5 under the index assignment at `LogitProcessor.py:68`) |

The formal shuffled evaluation therefore defaults to the **original** info file
(`INFO_MODE=original` in `scripts/eval_shuffled_sid.sh`), keeping the evaluation constraint
space unchanged. The shuffled info file is retained only as a consistency-audit artifact.

*(121 trie keys differ in the **order** of their allowed-token list. That ordering is set
by Python set iteration over insertion history; the sole consumer is
`mask[b, prefix_allowed_tokens] = 0`, an index assignment, so the order cannot affect the
result. Verified: masks built from the two orders are byte-identical.)*

### 13.5 Other standing caveats

- **Single seed** for every arm. No variance estimates; differences are not tested for
  significance.
- **One category, one dataset.** No claim generalises to other categories.
- **Compact SASRec** is a 4-config sweep, not a tuned baseline (§8.1).
- **The GRPO subset is fixed at 17 516 rows**, so GRPO sees much less data than SFT. The
  §6 conclusion is scoped to that subset.
- **Observational analyses (§9)** are correlational; §9.3 narrows but does not eliminate
  confounding.
- **Beam-restricted metric.** HR@20 is bounded by beam width 20; this is a beam-restricted
  metric, not a full-catalogue recall.

## 14. Sequence-only SID ablation

**Status:** completed. This section is the authoritative record for the seq-only arm.

### 14.1 Design

The `SidSFTDataset` path is kept; the two explicit text-auxiliary supervision paths are
removed:

| Component | Full SFT | Seq-only |
|---|---|---|
| `SidSFTDataset` (history SID -> target SID) | retained | **retained** |
| `SidItemFeatDataset` (title/description <-> SID alignment) | retained | **removed** |
| `FusionSeqRecDataset` (history SID -> target title) | retained | **removed** |

Implemented as `sft_mode in {"full", "seq_only"}` in `sft.py`; the mode is logged and the
launcher passes it explicitly. Both arms keep **identical** protocol constants
(epochs 2, `batch_size 64`, `micro_batch_size 16`, `gradient_accumulation_steps 4`,
`learning_rate 3e-4`, `cutoff_len 512`, `seed 42`, `sample -1`, `train_from_scratch False`,
`freeze_LLM False`, `bf16 True`, `optimizer adamw_torch`, `scheduler linear`,
`warmup_steps 20`), and differ in exactly four paths (`train_file`, `eval_file`,
`sid_index_path`, `output_dir`).

**Scope of the removal, stated precisely.** What is removed is the **explicit text
auxiliary supervision** (the title/description alignment objectives). It is **not** a
removal of all textual semantics from the system: the Semantic IDs themselves are produced
upstream by text quantisation (RQ-VAE), and that is unchanged in both arms.

Training shape follows from the dataset composition:

| Quantity | Full SFT | Seq-only |
|---|---|---|
| train samples | 79 834 (= 36 259 + 7 316 + 36 259) | **36 259** |
| `train dataset components` log line | three components | **36259 = 36259** (single component) |
| optimizer steps / epoch | 1 248 | **567** |
| max optimizer steps | 2 496 | **1 134** |
| eval interval (0.05) | 125 | **57** |
| actual final `global_step` | 2 496 | **1 134** |
| final epoch | 2.0 | 2.0 |
| early stopping | none | none |
| `train_loss` (all-step mean) | 0.7712313783569977 | 2.1893415668654064 |
| `train_runtime` | 1 532.3791 s | 758.5922 s |

Both seq-only arms ran the full 1 134 steps with no early stopping, with 19 evaluations at
steps 57, 114, ..., 1 083. Launch traces confirm `SFT mode: seq_only` and a single dataset
component, i.e. neither `SidItemFeatDataset` nor `FusionSeqRecDataset` was instantiated.

### 14.2 Clean seq-only

Formal protocol: ORIGINAL test split, 4 533 samples, beam 20, constrained SID decoding,
ORIGINAL INFO, `calc.py` unmodified.

| K | HR@K | NDCG@K |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.06618134 | 0.06618134 |
| 3 | 0.09353629 | 0.08182290 |
| 5 | 0.11361129 | 0.08999502 |
| 10 | 0.14339290 | 0.09966412 |
| **20** | **0.17802780** | **0.10842814** |

### 14.3 Shuffled seq-only

The same protocol with only the item<->SID assignment shuffled (strict shuffled builder,
seed 42) and the shuffled test split.

| K | HR@K | NDCG@K |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.05978381 | 0.05978381 |
| 3 | 0.07434370 | 0.06842129 |
| 5 | 0.08030002 | 0.07086086 |
| 10 | 0.08956541 | 0.07385714 |
| **20** | **0.10125745** | **0.07683363** |

### 14.4 Paired effect

| Metric | Clean | Shuffled | absolute d | relative d |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HR@20 | 0.17802780 | 0.10125745 | **-0.07677035** | **-43.1227 %** |
| NDCG@20 | 0.10842814 | 0.07683363 | **-0.03159451** | **-29.1387 %** |

Both arms were generated and scored identically: `legal_rate = 1.0`,
`duplicate_rate = 0.0`, source-target alignment 4533/4533 in both.

### 14.5 Comparison with the full-SFT intervention

| Arm | HR@20 clean -> shuffled | relative d | NDCG@20 clean -> shuffled | relative d |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Full SFT (section 10) | 0.19832341 -> 0.10765497 | **-45.7175 %** | 0.11786798 -> 0.08157358 | **-30.7924 %** |
| Seq-only (section 14) | 0.17802780 -> 0.10125745 | **-43.1227 %** | 0.10842814 -> 0.07683363 | **-29.1387 %** |

Absolute-drop ratio (seq-only / full): **0.8467** on HR@20, **0.8705** on NDCG@20.

**Permitted conclusion.** *The shuffled-SID effect remains large after removing the explicit
text auxiliary tasks, so the full-SFT intervention effect is not mainly dependent on those
auxiliary supervision paths.*

**Not claimed.** This does **not** prove a causal semantic hierarchy; it does **not** mean
text information was removed from the system (the SIDs remain text-quantised upstream); and
it is **not** a universal conclusion. It is one category, one dataset, single seed, and the
two arms differ by more than the auxiliary tasks: the full arm also trains on 79 834 samples
versus 36 259, so this is not a single-variable isolation.

---

## 15. Reference reproduction (formal clean SFT checkpoint)

**Status:** completed, PASS.

The formal clean SFT checkpoint was restored from its archive and re-evaluated under the
**formal protocol** (ORIGINAL test split, 4 533 samples, beam 20, `batch_size 8`,
`max_new_tokens 256`, `length_penalty 0`, `seed 42`, `K 0`, ORIGINAL INFO constrained
decoding), using the committed `evaluate.py` **default path** -- that is, with
`timing_callback = None` and `warmup_batches = 0`, so the benchmark instrumentation is
entirely inert.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| model | `runs/industrial_sft/final_checkpoint` |
| model SHA256 | `c362ed183daeb290299a475932ee9067cc0189e8199fac3fa080b054c12bffe8` |
| beam-20 prediction SHA256 | `51903f9babf883fbbd9b0ab9e22e1a41ed226a9caa80be5beb0bbad180a1fb36` |
| HR@20 | **0.19832341** |
| NDCG@20 | **0.11786798** |

Full curve re-derived by the unmodified `calc.py`:

| K | HR@K | NDCG@K |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.06926980 | 0.06926980 |
| 3 | 0.10103684 | 0.08789727 |
| 5 | 0.12111185 | 0.09613706 |
| 10 | 0.15376131 | 0.10663781 |
| **20** | **0.19832341** | **0.11786798** |

Integrity: 4 533 samples, 20 candidates per sample, source-target alignment 4533/4533,
`legal_rate = 1.0`, `duplicate_rate = 0.0`, `calc.py` CC = 0.

**The restored checkpoint under the formal protocol produces a byte-identical historical
prediction artifact.** The re-generated prediction matches the archived 2026-10-04
`eval_clean_sft/test_beam20.json` byte for byte (same SHA256 above, 4 740 761 bytes).

**Not claimed.** This does **not** cryptographically prove that the historical model weights
were identical, because a model SHA256 was not recorded separately at the time the original
prediction was produced.

---

## 16. Inference quality-latency benchmark

**Status:** completed. Formal HEAD `a5bbffbeb97ff43725807d04c72188a79c97184e`.

Design: the benchmark does not re-implement the recommender protocol. It imports the
repository's own `evaluate.py` and calls `evaluate.main()`, so prompts, SID parsing, the
constrained-decoding trie and the generation call are exactly the formal ones.
`warmup_batches = 3` leading batches run inside that same single call on the same loaded
model and are discarded. Timing is `torch.cuda.synchronize()`-bracketed around
`model.generate()` only, and `peak_vram_gb` is `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()` over the
measured window, reset after warmup and before the measured loop. Model loading, warmup,
JSON writing and `calc.py` are all excluded.

**Metric identity.** HR/NDCG come from the **unmodified `calc.py`** against the **ORIGINAL
INFO** universe. `calc.py`'s `item_path` builds `item_dict`, which is used only for its CC
counter and never participates in HR/NDCG. This was verified empirically: scoring the same
prediction file against the full 3 686-line codebook and against a 7-line codebook yields
bit-identical HR and NDCG, with only CC changing. No SID universe is therefore ever shrunk.

### 16.1 Quality sweep -- 4 533 rows, batch 8

| beam | HR@20 | NDCG@20 | throughput (samples/s) | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | peak_vram (GB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

beam 5 and beam 10 cannot report @20, because a beam-k run emits only k candidates. Those
cells are **absent, not zero**.

Per-cutoff quality for every beam (available cutoffs only):

| beam | HR@1 | HR@3 | HR@5 | HR@10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 0.0692698 | 0.09949261 | 0.11824399 | n/a |

The beam-20 / batch-8 configuration reproduced the formal clean SFT reference exactly
(`reference_match = True`), which is the protocol-identity check for the whole sweep.

### 16.2 Efficiency sweep -- beam 20, fixed first-512 workload

The workload is a materialised artifact:
`runs/inference_benchmark/_inputs/efficiency_subset_512.csv`, the first 512 rows of the
ORIGINAL test split in original order
(`selection = first_512_in_original_csv_order`), verified row-for-row identical to the
original's first 512 rows, SHA256
`5927985aae76180c008a2c687329579a2187ceb572304385b183d0e9a58e2d85`. All three batch sizes
evaluate exactly this file.

| batch | rows | batches | throughput (samples/s) | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | peak_vram (GB) | peak_device_used (GB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 512 | 512 | 11.534300906608772 | 85.62689460813999 | 90.66069684922695 | 1.0689444541931152 | 5.5343017578125 |
| **8** | 512 | 64 | 27.28226106430246 | 300.14239344745874 | 305.5367525666952 | 2.0326876640319824 | 5.5343017578125 |
| 32 | 512 | 16 | 30.33084794150578 | 1041.725986637175 | 1049.0986537188292 | 5.338920593261719 | 6.9874267578125 |

For batch 1 the single-request latency is the same measurement, recorded as
`request_latency_p50_ms = 85.62689460813999` and
`request_latency_p95_ms = 90.66069684922695`.

`peak_vram_gb` and `peak_device_used_gb` are different quantities and are deliberately
separately named: the former is PyTorch peak allocated memory over the measured generation
window, the latter is a device-level proxy that includes the CUDA context.

### 16.3 Interpretation

**Balanced operating point: `beam = 20, batch = 8`.**

- **beam 50 vs beam 20.** HR@20 0.19832341 -> 0.19942643 and NDCG@20
  0.11786798 -> 0.11818527, i.e. **+0.00110302 absolute (+0.1103 pp)** and
  **+0.00031729 absolute (+0.0317 pp)** -- a marginal Top-20 gain -- while throughput falls
  from 27.49 to 12.60 samples/s (**-54.2 %**, i.e. **0.458x**), P50 rises
  300.17 -> 649.25 ms (**2.16x**) and peak VRAM rises 2.033 -> 3.685 GB (**1.81x**).
- **batch 32 vs batch 8.** Throughput 27.28 -> 30.33 samples/s (**+11.2 %**, **1.112x**)
  only, while batch latency rises 300.14 -> 1 041.73 ms (**3.47x**) and peak VRAM rises
  2.033 -> 5.339 GB (**2.63x**).

No recommendation-quality claim is made from the efficiency sweep alone; its quality axis is
section 16.1.

---

## 17. Batch-invariance caveat (inference benchmark)

The efficiency sweep re-runs the **same 512 samples** at three batch sizes. Predictions were
compared row by row on `output.strip()` and on the `predict` list (not by file digest):

| comparison | exact prediction match rate | mismatch rows |
|---|---|---|
| batch 1 vs batch 8 | **0.0078125** | 508 / 512 |
| batch 1 vs batch 32 | **0.009765625** | 507 / 512 |

Aggregate quality on those same 512 rows (unmodified `calc.py`, ORIGINAL INFO):

| batch | HR@20 | NDCG@20 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **0.18359375** | 0.13043159 |
| 8 | **0.18359375** | 0.13039623 |
| 32 | **0.18359375** | 0.13022071 |

**Batch-dependent prediction divergence was observed, while aggregate HR/NDCG remained
nearly stable.**

This is recorded as an observation only. **No root cause is claimed** -- floating-point
non-determinism is not asserted here, because it has not been demonstrated for this system.
The divergence did **not** fail the benchmark: by design it is reported as a warning, and it
left the subset HR@20 unchanged and moved NDCG@20 by less than 2.2e-4.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|

| `scripts/sft_seq_only_shuffled.sh` | seq-only SFT on shuffled data (4 paths differ) |

| `analysis/benchmark_inference.py` | inference quality-latency benchmark with a `--preflight` mode (122 checks) |
| `scripts/benchmark_inference.sh` | benchmark launcher; its correctness gate delegates to the Python preflight |

### 18.4 Inference-benchmark method notes worth keeping

- **The benchmark never re-implements the protocol.** It imports the repository's own
  `evaluate.py`. An AST-based guard in `--preflight` asserts that
  `ConstrainedLogitsProcessor`, `GenerationConfig`, `LogitsProcessorList`, `EvalSidDataset`,
  `hash_dict` and `get_hash` appear neither as calls nor as literals in the benchmark.
- **Runtime import is checked for real.** An earlier revision passed 99 static checks and
  still failed at the first configuration with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'evaluate'`, because the repository root was not on `sys.path` while the check was only a
  source-text assertion. The preflight now performs the actual import through the
  benchmark's own configured `sys.path` and fails if it does not succeed.
- **The efficiency subset is a real file, not just an expected count.** An earlier revision
  declared `EFFICIENCY_SUBSET = 512` but still handed the original 4 533-row test CSV to
  `evaluate.main()`, so the efficiency arm silently evaluated the full split and the
  integrity gate failed with `sample count 4533 != expected 512`. The subset is now
  materialised, asserted (row count, header, row-for-row equality) and passed as
  `test_data_path`; the expected targets are read from that same path.
- **A launcher guard was a false positive.** The first launcher used a bare
  `grep -q 'analysis/results'` over the benchmark source, which matched the benchmark's own
  provenance assertion text and made the committed launcher refuse to run. That string
  search was deleted rather than replaced by another string search: the correctness gate now
  delegates to the AST-based Python preflight and requires exit 0 with zero failures.
- **Results are persisted atomically after every configuration**
  (temp file, `os.fsync`, `os.replace`), so a later failure cannot lose earlier
  configurations, and a failed configuration is recorded with `status = "FAILED"` rather
  than as a success.

### 19.4 Method notes worth keeping

- **`calc.py` NDCG scale.** `calc.py` accumulates `1/log(minID + 2)` with the **natural**
  logarithm and converts to the log2 scale only at print time by dividing by
  `1/log(2)`. Taking the intermediate sum at face value gives 0.17004756 instead of the
  correct 0.11786798.
- **`length_penalty`.** The value reaching `model.generate()` is the CLI value
  (**0** for the formal runs). The inner helper's `length_penalty=1.0` default is dead:
  the call site always passes the value explicitly.
- **`checkpoint-4379` is 0.25 epoch**, and `checkpoint-26274` is 1.5 epoch. See §6.1.

## 20. Qwen2.5-1.5B Backbone Scaling Sanity Check

The complete Clean vs. strict shuffled-SID protocol was repeated on a larger backbone in the
same family. 0.5B remains the project's main experimental backbone; 1.5B is a scaling
extension, not a second full replication.

### 20.1 Stage-A compatibility

| | 0.5B | 1.5B |
|---|---|---|
| model ID | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B` |
| variant | base (not `-Instruct`) | base (not `-Instruct`) |
| revision | — | `8faed761d45a263340a0528343f099c05c9a4323` |
| source `model.safetensors` SHA256 | — | `a961db72e75d52b18e6b0c9d379e51a26973b233385e0e127fdda7d648aec796` |
| parameters | 494,291,712 | 1,544,158,208 |
| ratio | | **3.1240x** |
| `model_type` / `architectures` | `qwen2` / `Qwen2ForCausalLM` | identical |
| tokenizer files | `tokenizer.json` / `vocab.json` / `merges.txt` | **byte-identical SHA256 to 0.5B** |

Compatibility verdict: 7/7 structural checks passed; `missing_keys = 0`,
`unexpected_keys = 0`, no load warnings.

#### SID-token extension (exact wording)

```
new SID tokenizer tokens                 = 560
tokenizer len                            : 151665 -> 152225
pretrained model embedding rows           = 151936
after resize                              = 152225
actual newly allocated embedding rows     = 289
```

The pretrained model already had **271** rows of embedding capacity that the tokenizer did
not occupy, so adding 560 SID tokens allocates only **289** genuinely new embedding rows.
**0.5B and 1.5B behave identically here** (the model capacity field is 151936 in both configs
while `len(tokenizer)` is 151665 in both). `tie_word_embeddings` stays `True` before and
after the resize on both backbones.

### 20.2 Memory probe (probe-only; not a formal run)

A probe-only early-stop hook (`probe_optimizer_steps`, default `-1` = disabled) runs the
**real** training configuration and stops after N genuine `optimizer.step()` calls, so the
formal recipe is untouched. Default `-1` leaves the formal path unchanged, proven by
constructing both `TrainingArguments` objects and comparing all 132 fields.

Probe configuration and result:

```
micro = 4    accum = 16    effective batch = 64
completed 4 real optimizer steps; no OOM
peak torch allocated = 14.7402 GiB
peak torch reserved  = 16.6797 GiB
peak device VRAM     = 17.1504 GiB   (nvidia-smi sampling; a separate metric)
optimizer state total = 5.7524 GiB
  exp_avg     = torch.bfloat16
  exp_avg_sq  = torch.bfloat16
  step        = torch.float32
  state entries = 338, all non-empty
```

**Why a real probe rather than arithmetic.** A paper assumption that the Adam state is fp32
would have predicted roughly 12.35 GB of optimizer state for 1.5B. In this environment
(`bf16=True`, `optim="adamw_torch"`) the two moments are materialised in **bf16**, i.e.
**5.7524 GiB** — the paper estimate overstates the real footprint by about 6.6 GB. Feasibility
was therefore decided by an actual optimizer-step probe, not by arithmetic.

The probe also **understates** the formal peak: the formal runs reach 20.2285 GiB device
because they additionally run 19 full validation passes and hold `load_best_model_at_end`
state, which a 4-step probe cannot observe.

### 20.3 1.5B Clean formal training

```
dataset : 36259 + 7316 + 36259 = 79834     valid = 4532
epochs = 2      micro = 4        accum = 16      effective batch = 64
lr = 3e-4       cutoff = 512     seed = 42
bf16            adamw_torch      linear scheduler      warmup = 20
full-parameter  freeze_LLM = False     train_from_scratch = False
optimizer steps = 2496
eval steps = 125 ... 2375  (19 evaluations, exactly the derived schedule)
```

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| `train_runtime` | 4378.2766 s |
| `train_loss` | 0.7255943729064595 |
| best eval loss | 1.5146195888519287 |
| best checkpoint | 2375 |
| peak device VRAM | 20.2285 GiB |
| final model bytes | 3,088,354,952 |
| final model SHA256 | `637d931a5f414e31634097843ce81288e95e2bcff04b049dbed23b65d437b6b9` |

`final_checkpoint/model.safetensors` is **byte-identical** to
`checkpoint-2375/model.safetensors` (same SHA256).

### 20.4 1.5B Clean beam-20 evaluation

Formal protocol: ORIGINAL test split, ORIGINAL info file, batch 8, beam 20,
`num_return_sequences = 20`, `max_new_tokens = 256`, `length_penalty = 0`, seed 42, K = 0,
constrained SID decoding, 4533 samples, cutoffs `[1, 3, 5, 10, 20]`.

```
HR   = [0.07103463, 0.10015442, 0.12000882, 0.15883521, 0.19964703]
NDCG = [0.07103463, 0.08793411, 0.09604022, 0.10844943, 0.11877667]
```

| integrity check | value |
|---|---|
| prediction SHA256 | `e39f7984c3f4d86141e96ca59698c3c321dda9766564908c986986d1e338a76b` |
| LegalRate | 1.0 |
| DuplicateRate | 0.0 |
| source-target alignment | 4533/4533 |

Comparison against 0.5B Clean:

| metric | 0.5B | 1.5B | absolute | percentage points | relative |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HR@20 | 0.19832341 | 0.19964703 | +0.00132362 | **+0.1324 pp** | **+0.6674 %** |
| NDCG@20 | 0.11786798 | 0.11877667 | +0.00090869 | **+0.0909 pp** | **+0.7709 %** |

**The improvement is small and is not uniform across cutoffs**: HR@3 and HR@5 are slightly
lower on 1.5B than on 0.5B, while HR@1 and HR@10 are higher. This is not evidence that
scaling is significantly effective.

### 20.5 1.5B strict shuffled formal training

Strict shuffled artifact hashes (all re-verified immediately before the run):

| artifact | SHA256 |
|---|---|
| `train.csv` | `3d9de81df61689c0afd54e3839f38e91e03cd5d51f894bc27224491148e843c2` |

| `mapping.json` | `3a10b26740c637591ee1aab51313673afbbba6e397fc7bba46a52adc2739a1ea` |

Intervention invariants are unchanged from the 0.5B study: collision-involved items frozen
(31 items / 15 groups), singletons permuted within train next-item popularity bins,
permutation seed 42, `singleton_fixed_points = 0`, `collision_items_changed = 0`, exact SID
set / multiset preserved, trie topology preserved, vocab preserved.

**Same formal recipe as Clean** — the only experimental variable is the item-to-SID
assignment. Same dataset counts (36259 + 7316 + 36259 = 79834 / valid 4532), same 2496
optimizer steps, same 19 evaluations at steps 125 ... 2375.

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| `train_runtime` | 4416.7565 s |
| `train_loss` | 0.7635543977913375 |
| best eval loss | 1.639657974243164 |
| best step | 2375 |

`final_checkpoint/model.safetensors` is **byte-identical** to
`checkpoint-2375/model.safetensors`. It differs from the Clean 1.5B model (different SHA256),
so no checkpoint was mixed between the two arms.

#### ENOSPC failure record (kept as evidence, excluded from the formal results)

The **first** attempt at this run failed at the very first checkpoint save:

```
directory : runs/qwen2p5_1p5b_shuffled_sft_failed_enospc_20261007_1153/
window    : 2026-10-07 11:48:22 -> 11:53:03
```

- the data disk reached **100 % (2.1 MB free)** while writing the 6.18 GB `optimizer.pt` of
  the step-125 checkpoint
- symptom: `RuntimeError: [enforce fail at inline_container.cc:626] .
  unexpected pos 523583488 vs 523583380` — `optimizer.pt` truncated at 523,632,896 B
- `torchrun` exited 1; the step-125 `model.safetensors` was complete but the optimizer state
  was truncated
- remedy: data disk expanded **50 GB -> 100 GB**, then the formal run was **restarted from
  scratch**
- **no resume** was performed from the truncated optimizer state
- the failed directory was **renamed only** (contents unchanged, verified by SHA256) and
  retained; its files are **not** part of the formal results

The model in that failed directory must not be reported as a formal result.

### 20.6 1.5B shuffled beam-20 evaluation

Formal protocol: **strict shuffled TEST + ORIGINAL INFO** (the original info file keeps the
constrained-decoding legal SID space identical to Clean; the strict shuffled construction
already preserves the same SID set / multiset / trie topology). All other decoding parameters
are identical to the Clean and 0.5B shuffled formal evaluations; the default
`evaluate.py` path was used with no benchmark timing callback.

```
HR   = [0.06397529, 0.08118244, 0.08890360, 0.10169865, 0.11625855]

| shuffled relative-drop difference between backbones | +3.9495 pp | +2.4432 pp |

Bounded conclusion (verbatim):

> Scaling Qwen2.5 from 0.5B to 1.5B produced only a small change in Clean Top-K
> performance, while the large degradation under the strict shuffled-SID intervention
> persisted.

> This is a single-seed, single-category scaling sanity check; it is not evidence of
> statistical significance or universal backbone invariance.

Clean and shuffled rows are scored against **different splits** (a shuffled target SID is not
comparable to a clean one), so the drop columns — not cross-column differences — carry the
meaning. Only **absolute** differences and **percentage points** are reported for the
cross-backbone deltas; **relative** percentages are used only for the within-arm drops.
No significance test was performed.

Archive contents: both `final_checkpoint` model+tokenizer sets, both `train.log`, both formal
predictions, both `evaluate.log`, both `metrics.txt`, the strict shuffled inputs, the Stage-A
probe provenance, and the manifest (`qwen2p5_1p5b_scaling_manifest.txt`).

Deliberately **excluded** from the archive: every `optimizer.pt` (training complete, 6.18 GB
each), the duplicate `checkpoint-2375` model (byte-identical to `final_checkpoint`), the
failed ENOSPC directory (retained separately on the server), and the downloaded base
checkpoint (its provenance is the revision plus the source SHA256 recorded in §20.1).
